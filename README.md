# Marksman

A graphical interface for [Assassin](https://v0lttech.com/assassin.php).


## Description

Assassin is a platform built to integrate devices and sensors in an automotive context. While it's plenty powerful alone, many users find it's command line interface to be limiting. Marksman is a companion tool that aims to be a clean, modern dashboard that displays information directly from Assassin from nearly any device with a web browser.
